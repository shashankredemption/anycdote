              <h2>From Finances to Father</h2>
              <p>I worked in mutual funds for most of my life, but I'm in the ministry now. I grew up in The Faith. Then I ended up working on Wall Street. And I actually enjoyed the work a lot. For me it was less about the money and more about the excitement and buzz of going to work everyday. I enjoyed making deals and getting things done. But in the end, I just missed God. </p>

              <p>Both my kids will have graduated from college in 4.5 years, and I'm heading to Mexico. I'm not kidding. Social Security goes a long way down there. For $300 a week, I could have a place to stay, a satellite dish, a fishing pole, and some rum. </p>

              <h2>Summer in New Orleans</h2>
              <p>Well I can tell you a moment of really simple joy. I was squatting down in New Orleans, living off donations, and one day I was able to obtain ice, lemons, and sugar all at the same time. So I had lemonade for the entire day. It was right after Katrina hit. I was twenty years old, in the midst of a righteous political phase, and I didn't really have plans for the summer. So I said: 'Racist shit is happening in New Orleans! I've got to get down there! </p>

              <h2>Respect</h2>
              <p>My mom had me when she was really young. We always had more of a friendship than a mother-daughter relationship. You know, I'd always talk to her about my friends and my issues, things like that. I've always been really free to speak my mind. But now that I'm older, and I'm discovering more and more things that I disagree with her about, she doesn't think I respect her enough. </p>

              <h2>Moonwatch</h2>
              <p>In my youth, I enjoyed running outside without a watch. With nothing to tell the time but the sun! And nothing to call you home but the moon! </p>

              <h2>Money Tree</h2>
              <p>My greatest struggle is trying to support my mom and sisters back in Jamaica. I try to send money back every month, but sometimes I just can't do it after I've paid my bills. They really depend on the money, because my stepfather is a farmer and a lot of times the crops aren't good. A lot of people back home think that money comes easy in America. They don't know how hard it is. </p>
