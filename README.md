# Anycdote

Get in touch with the soul of the city! Anycdote allows you to anonymously submit, read, and listen to stories of the people of New York. Stories, submitted in a certain area, populate the screen based on your location in the city. Check out [*aNYCdote*](http://www.anycdote.herokuapp.com) and feel free to submit a story as long as it is under 260 characters.
